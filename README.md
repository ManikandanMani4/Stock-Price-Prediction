# üìà Stock Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

## üìå Abstract

The art of forecasting stock prices has long posed a significant challenge for researchers, financial analysts, and data scientists. The stock market is influenced by countless unpredictable factors ‚Äî from economic indicators to investor sentiment ‚Äî making it highly volatile and complex. Despite these challenges, **stock price prediction remains a highly researched and investor-focused area**, as successful forecasts can lead to profitable investment strategies.

This project explores machine learning techniques to predict the **future direction of stock prices**, using historical stock data and indicators such as moving averages, volume, open-close price changes, and technical trends. By applying algorithms like **Linear Regression, Random Forest, and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**, we aim to model the patterns hidden in time-series stock data to provide reliable predictions.

A good prediction system benefits traders, investors, and analysts by offering insights that support decision-making in real time. This system doesn't just forecast prices‚Äîit empowers users with data-backed confidence in the unpredictable world of stock markets.
